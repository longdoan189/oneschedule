They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can also spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. The course focuses on building a skill set specific to the study of the visual realm and provides a sound foundation in relevant theories such as technologies of vision, surveillance, the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and cinema and spectatorship. This skill set is crucial to analyzing, interpreting, and historicizing various forms of art, including fine art such as painting and sculpture as well as popular art such as advertisements, film, television, and images and videos circulated on online platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. No prior experience in visual analysis is required.","notes":"\u2022 Level: Foundation\\n\u2022 Prerequisites: No\\n\u2022 Reading/Writing Intensive\\n\u2022 Course Format: In-person\\n\u2022 Note: This introductory course is required for all Art and Media Studies majors (If you have taken Visual Culture previously, you have already completed this requirement). \\n\u2022 ","schedule":[{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"1:15 PM","end_time":"4:15 PM"}]},{"id":"ARTS102_Spring2021_S02","type":"Semester","title":"Introduction to Art History and Theory","credits":4,"instructor":"Pamela Corey","start_date":"11/1/2021","end_date":"28/05/2021","capacity":25,"description":"This course introduces students to the tools of the art historian.

Important questions that will surface throughout our discussions include the relationship of artistic form to context, the very notion of art as history, and the possibilities and challenges of a truly \'global\' art history.

We will examine the historical negotiations of major religious traditions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam, through visual, material, and performative practices, as well as gain a familiarity with how these artistic forms retain their vitality and resonance in the present, whether it be through contemporary art or in debates about national identity and cultural heritage. Following both a chronological and thematic structure, we will study such topics as indigenous modes of dwelling, the theory of \'Indianization\' and works of Hindu-Buddhist art, the modern Islamic arts, and contemporary art in Southeast Asia and its diasporas.

We will consider such developments in their local, national, and global contexts, while addressing the transnational nature of certain movements as well sites of exchange and dialogue between artistic communities in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. In addition, we will query how modern artists have been perceived as spearheading and/or expanding practices and discourses associated with primitivism, realism, surrealism, abstraction, and collectivism, among others. Through a selection of case studies each week we will explore how modernism forged new directions at the level of form, materiality, practice, and the very nature of representation, but also in the shaping of art as a means of expression and site of critical dialogue embedded in and acting upon society.","notes":"\u2022 Level: Intermediate\\t\\n\u2022 Prerequisites: ARTS 101 \u2013 Introduction to Visual Studies (or Visual Culture)\\n\u2022 Course Format: In-person\\n\u2022 Note: The first few weeks of this class will be online. \\n\u2022 ","schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"1:15 PM","end_time":"4:15 PM"}]},{"id":"ARTS205_Spring2021_S01","type":"Semester","title":"Art for Social Change: The Curator\'s Roles in Non-Institutional Exhibition Making","credits":4,"instructor":"Nhung Walsh","start_date":"11/1/2021","end_date":"28/05/2021","capacity":25,"description":"This course discusses the roles of the curators and exhibition makers in the field of contemporary art.

How are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisiting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine.  From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.","notes":"\u2022 Level: Intermediate\\n\u2022 Prerequisites: CS 101 \u2013 Computer Science 1, or equivalent programming experience.\\n\u2022 Course Format: In-person\\n\u2022 Cross-listed: [CS \u2013 Computer Science], [ENG \u2013 Engineering]\\n\u2022 ","schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"9:00AM","end_time":"12:00PM"}]},{"id":"CS302_Spring2021_S01","type":"Quarter 3","title":"Theory of Computing","credits":4,"instructor":"Hung Son Nguyen","start_date":"11/1/2021","end_date":"26/03/2021","capacity":25,"description":"Sometime in middle school, you were taught how to multiply and add large numbers.

Plato\u2019s story of the Ring of Gyges, which grants invisibility to its wearer, aims to instruct us about the nature of morality. Einstein reasons from examples about moving trains to argue about the relativity of simultaneity. Parfit imagines various teletransportation scenarios to ask questions about the necessary conditions for the persistence of human identity over time. Any number of legal and ethical theorists substantiate their arguments by asking variations of questions about fat guys and bridges, children and trolley lines. Whatever status one grants to particular thought experiments and to the cogency of the technique in general, the philosopher, the physicist, and the legal theorist all concur in employing the devices of fiction as an integral part of their reasoning.","notes":"\u2022 Level: Intermediate\\n\u2022 Prerequisites: No\\n\u2022 Reading/ Writing Intensive\\n\u2022 Course Format: Online\\n\u2022 ","schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"6:30 PM","end_time":"8:00 PM"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"6:30 PM","end_time":"8:00 PM"}]},{"id":"LIT204_Spring2021_S01","type":"Semester","title":"Identity, Community, and Memory in Vietnamese Diasporic Literature and Film","credits":4,"instructor":"Isadora Wagner","start_date":"11/1/2021","end_date":"28/05/2021","capacity":25,"description":"Students taking this course will examine issues of family, identity, memory, community, violence, and trauma in the global literature of the Vietnamese diaspora from the French colonial period (1887-1954) to the end of the American-Vietnam War (1956-1975) and into the present. Bi-weekly class discussions will be based on substantial weekly readings (100pp./week) in poetry, fiction, memoir, film, and essays that anchor the class\u2019s exploration of how a scattered and war-displaced people (re)constructs identities, communities, and memories through cultural representations in literature and film.

Through class discussions, presentations, and writing assignments, students will develop skills to critically interpret women\u2019s real and fantasized relationships to modern wars. Students will also develop a vocabulary in gender and feminist studies through the applied use of terms and concepts like gender construction, differences between gender and sex, gender performance, gender non-conformity, intersectionality, interpellations between societal gender and war structures, and the mobilization of gendered identities for militarized purposes in the U.S. and Vietnam during the Vietnam War Era.

One can wake up, grab their phone, catch up with news and friends from around the world, all before leaving the bed.  For all humans spending their lives in towns, villages, and cities, from one side of the world to another, most of us spend much of our lives in cyberspace.  The meaning of \u201cgoing there\u201d has changed, and the Internet is fundamental to that change. We log into the Internet, go online, visit websites, surf the web, navigate pages, and so forth.  Even the language we use to talk about the Internet is one of travel, of spatial belonging and exploration. This course considers how the Internet, and in particular, online communities and cyberspace are redefining what it means to be human.  As much as this is a course about digital belonging, this is also a course of digital belonging.  Through a reflexive analysis of our digital connectivity within the class, we can challenge our own assumptions about what it means to exist in digital spaces.  Some online spaces we will explore are: Social Media Influencers, E-Sports, Online Forums (including parenting, suicide, and dating), Hacktivism, Wikipedia, and, of course, Facebook. Some theoretical concepts we explore are social theories of modernization, materiality, actor network theory, social capital, identity, space, virtuality, the state, and surveillance. This course offers a general introduction to social science and anthropological research methods, and theories, with a specific emphasis on cultures of and in new media (internet, mobile phone, etc.).   As a final project, students will develop and conduct a mini-ethnography of an online community of their choosing.

Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability.  Human language is not just about communication. Words, to quote JL Austin, \\"do things\\".  Phrases like, \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity.  Language is intimately tied to experience, were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d?, or an insult?  Ultimately, as much as language is something that humans make, language is also part of what makes us human.  This course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology.  Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics.  These concepts include linguistic relativity, code, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing.  In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. These themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.  Please note, this is not a linguistics course.  We will not be learning new languages or the technical components of syntactic structures. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as core texts will be in English and many draws upon English for examples.","notes":"\u2022 Level: Intermediate\\t\\n\u2022 Prerequisites: No\\n\u2022 Reading/Writing Intensive\\n\u2022 Course Format: In-person\\n\u2022 Cross-listed: [SOCI \u2013 Social Science], [LIT - Literature], [PSY \u2013 Psychology]\\n\u2022 ","schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"4:45 PM","end_time":"6:15 PM"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"4:45 PM","end_time":"6:15 PM"}]},{"id":"VS201_Spring2021_S01","type":"Semester","title":"Going Hand in Hand: Politics and Economic Development in Contemporary Vietnam","credits":4,"instructor":"Nguyen Thanh Trung","start_date":"11/1/2021","end_date":"28/05/2021","capacity":30,"description":"To help Vietnam become an active participant in today\u2019s world requires a basic understanding of the country and the broader Asia-Pacific region.

This course helps students understand how politics, history, culture, and customs could have an impact on the rapidly changing economy and society in contemporary Vietnam. It will focus on the discussion how political, economic and social forces shape a \u201csocialism-oriented market economy\u201d as the Vietnamese government claims. Put simply, the primary focus is on the interrelationships among individuals, governments, and public policy. The course is organized into two broad primary portions: 1) The history of Vietnam and the Vietnam\u2019s economic renovation (Doi Moi) since 1986; and 2) Contemporary issues the country is facing. This first part will only capture the key periods and turning points in historical Vietnam, which is necessary for understanding how historical institutions continue to shape the nation\u2019s politics and economy today. The remainder of the course will be on the Vietnamese economic reform since 1986 and contemporary issues, with an emphasis on the relationship between politics and economic development, plus cross-country comparisons as well as key challenges facing the Vietnamese Communist Party leadership, such as regime stability, pollution, and political reform.","notes":"\u2022 Level:

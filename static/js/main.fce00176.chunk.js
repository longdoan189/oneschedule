They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can also spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. The course focuses on building a skill set specific to the study of the visual realm and provides a sound foundation in relevant theories such as technologies of vision, surveillance, the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and cinema and spectatorship. This skill set is crucial to analyzing, interpreting, and historicizing various forms of art, including fine art such as painting and sculpture as well as popular art such as advertisements, film, television, and images and videos circulated on online platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. No prior experience in visual analysis is required.","notes":"\u2022 Level: Foundation\\n\u2022 Prerequisites: No\\n\u2022 Reading/Writing Intensive\\n\u2022 Course Format: In-person\\n\u2022 Note: This introductory course is required for all Art and Media Studies majors (If you have taken Visual Culture previously, you have already completed this requirement). \\n\u2022 ","schedule":[{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"1:15 PM","end_time":"4:15 PM"}]},{"id":"ARTS102_S02","type":"Semester","title":"Introduction to Art History and Theory","credits":4,"instructor":"Pamela Corey","start_date":"11/1/2021","end_date":"28/05/2021","capacity":25,"description":"This course introduces students to the tools of the art historian.

We will examine the historical negotiations of major religious traditions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam, through visual, material, and performative practices, as well as gain a familiarity with how these artistic forms retain their vitality and resonance in the present, whether it be through contemporary art or in debates about national identity and cultural heritage. Following both a chronological and thematic structure, we will study such topics as indigenous modes of dwelling, the theory of \'Indianization\' and works of Hindu-Buddhist art, the modern Islamic arts, and contemporary art in Southeast Asia and its diasporas.

How are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisiting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine.  From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows.

More puzzling than the fact that poets, physicists, and lawyers are united in using thought experiments is the fundamental challenge of thought experimentation generally.

Any number of legal and ethical theorists substantiate their arguments by asking variations of questions about fat guys and bridges, children and trolley lines.

The course is divided into six modules of roughly 2-3 weeks length each to thematize readings around the following topic clusters: (1) Memory, Displacement, and Nostalgia; (2) Auto-Narrative and Identity; (3) Diasporic Overseas Communities; (4) Generational Conflict and Assimilation Issues; (5) Race, Labor, Gender, and Class; and (6) Re-imagining Viet Nam\u2019s Past and Future. Each module ends with an optional film screening to be scheduled outside of class hours as a capstone.

Drawing from fiction, film, memoir, news articles, poems, cartoons, and historical and feminist works, we will analyze women\u2019s contributions to warfare in the following roles: as mothers, nurses, wives, resistance fighters, base workers, sex workers, war brides, anti-war protestors, journalists, humanitarians, soldiers, and political leaders. Students taking this course will gain a deeper appreciation of Vietnamese and U.S. women\u2019s history and the issues surrounding women\u2019s portrayals as nurturers, breeders, protected others, betrayers, victims, consumers, sexual provocateurs, and woman warriors. Through class discussions, presentations, and writing assignments, students will develop skills to critically interpret women\u2019s real and fantasized relationships to modern wars. Students will also develop a vocabulary in gender and feminist studies through the applied use of terms and concepts like gender construction, differences between gender and sex, gender performance, gender non-conformity, intersectionality, interpellations between societal gender and war structures, and the mobilization of gendered identities for militarized purposes in the U.S. and Vietnam during the Vietnam War Era.

Probability and statistics is a mathematical theory that can help us understand about the randomness of events and use the data from the past to predict the future. In this course, we will explore the nature of random events and build up the mathematical models and tools that can be used to calculate the chance of event happening. With a strong foundation we will also consider many real-world problems on how to handle and understand data and make meaningful statistical inference. The applications come from many areas such as industrial quality control, market share prediction and even a little bit of Las Vegas gambling.","notes":"\u2022 Level: Intermediate\\n\u2022 Prerequisites: MATH 101 \u2013 Calculus and MATH 105 - Introduction to Data Analysis (recommended but not required)\\n\u2022 Course Format: Online on Minerva Platform. \\n\u2022 ","schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"1:15 PM","end_time":"2:45 PM"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"1:15 PM","end_time":"2:45 PM"}]},{"id":"PSY101_S01","type":"Semester","title":"Introductory Psychology","credits":4,"instructor":"Jill Siri","start_date":"11/1/2021","end_date":"28/05/2021","capacity":25,"description":"This course is designed to be an Engaged Inquiry into psychology, focusing not just on helping students to get to know what psychology is, but also helping students develop important critical and scientific thinking skills as they engage in collaborative and reflective learning.

One can wake up, grab their phone, catch up with news and friends from around the world, all before leaving the bed.  For all humans spending their lives in towns, villages, and cities, from one side of the world to another, most of us spend much of our lives in cyberspace.  The meaning of \u201cgoing there\u201d has changed, and the Internet is fundamental to that change. We log into the Internet, go online, visit websites, surf the web, navigate pages, and so forth.  Even the language we use to talk about the Internet is one of travel, of spatial belonging and exploration. This course considers how the Internet, and in particular, online communities and cyberspace are redefining what it means to be human.  As much as this is a course about digital belonging, this is also a course of digital belonging.  Through a reflexive analysis of our digital connectivity within the class, we can challenge our own assumptions about what it means to exist in digital spaces.  Some online spaces we will explore are: Social Media Influencers, E-Sports, Online Forums (including parenting, suicide, and dating), Hacktivism, Wikipedia, and, of course, Facebook. Some theoretical concepts we explore are social theories of modernization, materiality, actor network theory, social capital, identity, space, virtuality, the state, and surveillance. This course offers a general introduction to social science and anthropological research methods, and theories, with a specific emphasis on cultures of and in new media (internet, mobile phone, etc.).   As a final project, students will develop and conduct a mini-ethnography of an online community of their choosing.

Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability.  Human language is not just about communication. Words, to quote JL Austin, \\"do things\\".  Phrases like, \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity.  Language is intimately tied to experience, were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d?, or an insult?  Ultimately, as much as language is something that humans make, language is also part of what makes us human.  This course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology.  Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics.  These concepts include linguistic relativity, code, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing.  In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. These themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.  Please note, this is not a linguistics course.  We will not be learning new languages or the technical components of syntactic structures. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as core texts will be in English and many draws upon English for examples.","notes":"\u2022 Level: Intermediate\\t\\n\u2022 Prerequisites: No\\n\u2022 Reading/Writing Intensive\\n\u2022 Course Format: In-person\\n\u2022 Cross-listed: [SOCI \u2013 Social Science], [LIT - Literature], [PSY \u2013 Psychology]\\n\u2022 ","schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"4:45 PM","end_time":"6:15 PM"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"4:45 PM","end_time":"6:15 PM"}]},{"id":"VS201_S01","type":"Semester","title":"Going Hand in Hand: Politics and Economic Development in Contemporary Vietnam","credits":4,"instructor":"Nguyen Thanh Trung","start_date":"11/1/2021","end_date":"28/05/2021","capacity":30,"description":"To help Vietnam become an active participant in today\u2019s world requires a basic understanding of the country and the broader Asia-Pacific region.

Given its growing economic size and political influence, Vietnam\u2019s regional footprint is progressively noticeable. This course helps students understand how politics, history, culture, and customs could have an impact on the rapidly changing economy and society in contemporary Vietnam. It will focus on the discussion how political, economic and social forces shape a \u201csocialism-oriented market economy\u201d as the Vietnamese government claims. Put simply, the primary focus is on the interrelationships among individuals, governments, and public policy. The course is organized into two broad primary portions: 1) The history of Vietnam and the Vietnam\u2019s economic renovation (Doi Moi) since 1986; and 2) Contemporary issues the country is facing. This first part will only capture the key periods and turning points in historical Vietnam, which is necessary for understanding how historical institutions continue to shape the nation\u2019s politics and economy today. The remainder of the course will be on the Vietnamese economic reform since 1986 and contemporary issues, with an emphasis on the relationship between politics and economic development, plus cross-country comparisons as well as key challenges facing the Vietnamese Communist Party leadership, such as regime stability, pollution, and political reform.","notes":"\u2022 Level: Intermediate\\n\u2022 Prerequisites: \\n\u2022 Reading/Writing Intensive\\n\u2022 Course Format: In-person\\n\u2022 ","schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"9:00AM","end_time":"12:00PM"}]}]')}},[[450,1,2]]]);
